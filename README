android_bash

Bash, cross-compiled and modified for the android platform.

Modifications include:

  Adjusted path of init files (.bashrc, .profile, etc) from '~/' to '/data/local/'.
  Added support for storing init files on '/mnt/sdcard/' (only used when the files do not exist in '/data/local/').
  Some default init files are included as (working) examples.
  Stripped for size (args used for stripping: '-d --strip-unneeded').
